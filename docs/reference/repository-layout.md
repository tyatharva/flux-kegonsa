## What was removed on 2026-09-04, and where its information went

The repository was cut from 2059 tracked files to about 830 for public release. Everything
removed is kept in the author's offline pre-cleanup archive of 2026-09-04 (the full working tree with
its history, 9.1 GB), and the information each item held is in these pages.

| removed | count | information now in |
|---|---|---|
| the project brief that served as the working notes (the previous README-equivalent) | 1 | every page of this site. The [standing rules](standing-rules.md), [ruled out](ruled-out.md) and [limitations](../limitations-and-future-work.md) pages keep its substance |
| `FASTEDDY_VERSION.txt`, the fork checkout | 1 | `fasteddy/`, [FastEddy and the patches](../les/fasteddy-and-patches.md) |
| `lib/liblpdm.so` (a compiled sm_89 binary) | 1 | rebuilt by `docker/build_lpdm.sh` |
| `vast-seeds/`: 342 files byte-identical to `seeds/*/return/` | 342 | the 4 unique files moved to `results/seed_library/` |
| `jobs/` (the 16 m seed library), `jobs24/` (the 24 m rung), `jobs30/` renamed `seeds/` | 147 | [seed rungs](../history/seed-rungs.md), [seed library](../les/seed-library.md) |
| `seeds/*/return/{run,seed}.log` (raw FastEddy stdout) | 60 | the verdicts beside them |
| `runs/`: 58 retired-grid directories, 133 `.in` files | 133 | [stages 0–2](../history/stages-0-2.md), [passes 3–7](../history/pass-3.md) |
| `results/`: the 16 m and 24 m record (`g16*`, `g16p6*`, `g16r*`, `g24*`, `fv_*`, `frame_sweep_*`, `cbl_*.txt`, `stage*`, `pass6*`, `retired_sbl_*`, `.done*`, `keep/`, `CLEANUP_INVENTORY.txt`, …) | 345 | the history pages, each of which names what it condensed |
| `results/ml/phase1/*/`, `phase2/trials/`, `haze/*/` per-run files, `eval/early_b0x` | 168 | `summary.*` and `trials.tsv` beside them. [Training](../emulator/training.md). [Emulator timeline](../history/emulator-timeline.md) |
| 51 retired campaign drivers and one-off analyses in `bin/` | 51 | named at the foot of each history page. The dependency closure of the production path, the tests and the ML imports kept 80 scripts |
| `figures/raw/` (the nine pair figures on `corpus_raw.h5`) | 9 | one documented command regenerates them ([figures](../corpus/figures.md)) |
| `validation_pairs_retired/` (16 m records) | 7 | [target case](../history/target-case.md) |
| `docs/` (31 files: five design documents and 25 pass write-ups) | 31 | this site |
| `docs/host_toolchain_install.txt` | 1 | [environment](../getting-started/environment.md) |
| the local branch `wip/producer-consumer-zarr` (324 commits, disjoint history) | | [unmerged work](../history/unmerged-producer-consumer.md) |

What moved: `jobs30/` → `seeds/`. `jobs/run_seed.sh`, `jobs/seed_watch.sh` → `bin/`. The five
poster PNGs → `figures/poster/`. `SRC/LPDM/CUDA/` from the fork → `lpdm/cuda/`. What became
tracked: `data/grid30_raised/`, `corpus/{README.md,INDEX.json,FLAGGED.tsv,provenance/}`,
`LICENSE`, `CITATION.cff`, `assets/SHA256SUMS`, `bin/fetch_assets.sh`, `fasteddy/`.

## Conventions

- Every FastEddy invocation goes through `docker/run_case.sh`. Every analysis script runs in the
  image through `docker/pyrun.sh`. The host Python has no scipy or h5py by design.
- One run per directory. A dump is `<outFileBase>.<step>`. Every glob filters on one base name.
- Paths in scripts are repository-relative and the root is found from the script's own
  location (`FLUX_ROOT`), so a checkout works anywhere.
- `results/<thing>.txt` is the human-readable record and `<thing>.json` the machine-readable one
  of the same measurement.
- Shell drivers only sequence steps. Logic is in `bin/*.py`, because bash reads a running
  script by byte offset and Python does not (traps §19d).
